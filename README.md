# Ansible

Another Ansible Docker image for my own needs.
This image is based on https://github.com/willhallonline/docker-ansible.

## But... Why?

I wanted to :
- have an Ansible image with Mitogen supports (who likes to wait?),
- define my ansible.cfg once for all,
- have the ability to mount SSH keys as a volume without encountering a permission issue (eg, with Docker Desktop on Windows)
- learn how to release public Docker images.

## Usage

TBD
